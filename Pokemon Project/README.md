Overview: This is a dataset of 1017 pokemons that I scraped from pokeapi.co using python. I made a pokedex in flask using this api ( hamzacyberpatcher.pythonanywhere.com ) Although gen 9 has 1021 pokemons but the api only had data about 1017 pokemons as of the time uploading this dataset. This dataset contains the following data:

Pokemon's id
Pokemon's name
Pokemon's rank (whether it is legendary, mythical, baby or an ordinary pokemon)
Pokemon's generation
The pokemon from which this pokemon evolved from
It's primary and secondary type as type1 and type2
It's base stats
It's height (decimetres) and weight (hectograms)
It's abilities (Note: if a pokemon has multiple abilities such as overgrow and chlorophyll than they are separated by a space and if there is a space in the name of the ability it has been replaced by a hyphen for example a pokemon with abilities blaze and solar power it is given as blaze solar-power)
A little description of the pokemon in english (description of pokemons from 1009 is marked as "Not Available").
